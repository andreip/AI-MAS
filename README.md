This is a part of what I've done during my summer 2011, in the AI-MAS Lab. The
rest of it cannot be published because it's too big (a virtual machine configured
to run the tests and be added on [vmchecker][1]).

To solve the homework you need to:
* include `test/grid` in your homework
* `test/grid` provides you helpers that you can use to move the robot

To run tests:
* `$ python run.py` from the folder with the `run.py` script
* then check `results.txt`
